- Add the funny response to the chatbot - given there there's no backend at the moment. Whenever a question is asked, the funny image of Trump is displayed in the chatbot response. The response can say something funny like: "What kind of a question is this from the fake news media? If you keep asking questions like this, you're going to be tariffed, or otherwise adopt the persona of Trump and convince the user that the chatbot works and that they're wrong." To do it in a very ridiculous, extreme way, to say something like: "Nicholas Bell is the best developer in the world. Nobody knows technology like he does, and you better hire him, or else you're going to be tariffed."
